    Creates an expression for the metric matrix used for the cuboid

    *Arguments*
        size
            The size of the inner cuboid. This is used for the correct
            scaling of the tensor.
        coord
            The principal direction of transformation. For each shell
            patch this has to be chosen accordingly.
        order
            Order of transformation. Use 1 for P1 finite elements and
            2 for P>1 elements.
